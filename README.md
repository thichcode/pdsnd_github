Analytics about the bike share service

### Description
The code you provided is a Python script that analyzes bikeshare data for different cities. It prompts the user to input a city, month, and day to filter the data and then displays various statistics based on the filtered data.

Here's a summary of the code:

    The script starts by importing necessary libraries such as time, pandas, and numpy.

    The CITY_DATA dictionary contains the filenames for the bikeshare data for different cities.

    The get_filters() function asks the user to input the city, month, and day to analyze. It validates the user input and returns the chosen filters.

    The load_data() function loads the data for the specified city and filters it based on the chosen month and day. It returns a Pandas DataFrame containing the filtered data.

    The time_stats(), station_stats(), trip_duration_stats(), and user_stats() functions calculate and display various statistics on the most frequent times of travel, popular stations and trips, trip duration, and user demographics, respectively.

    The display_data() function allows the user to view the raw data upon request.

    The main() function is the entry point of the script. It repeatedly prompts the user for filters, loads the data, and displays the statistics. It also allows the user to restart the analysis or exit the program.

To use this script, you need to have the bikeshare data files (chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv) in the same directory as the script.

### Files used
